# Exercise 1

## Question 1:
For this exercise I picked Python. Linting is done with flake8, testing with Pytest and building and packaging with Poetry.

## Question 2:
Aside from Jenkins and Github actions, I found options such as Travis-CI, Tox and Buildbot. Travis-CI seems pretty neat since it can be easily integrated with GitHub. It can even comment on pull requests whether changes made break the build or not. Tox also seems to have cool features such as running tests in all specified environments and reducing boilerplate.

## Question 3:
Definitely a cloud-based environment would be used. The team is small and while the scope of the project is not specified, it would almost surely be small to medium sized. Setting up a self-hosted environment would not be worth the hassle and it could actually hinder development since some of the 6 people would have to be taken off development to set it up. However if the project requires a lot of resources and/or a graphics environment for example, a self-hosted environment would be necessary. Resource wise it would be expensive to use cloud-based hosting and graphics environment is usually not possible.
